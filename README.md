#  The Sparks Foundation Tasks


This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for [The Sparks Foundation.](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)
- **Author**              - Rajdeep Porua
- **Internship Category** - Data Science and Business Analytics
- **Internship Duration** - 2 Month ( April 2023 - May 2023  )
- **Internship Type**     - Virtual

### # Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML 

1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
2. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
3. Data can be found at [http://bit.ly/w](http://bit.ly/w)
4. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
5. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

### # Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML 

1. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
2. Use R or Python or perform this task.
3. Data can be found at [https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j](https://bit.ly/3cGyP8j)

### # Task-3 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

1. For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
2. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
3. Data can be found at [https://bit.ly/3kXTdox](https://bit.ly/3kXTdox)
